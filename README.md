# Buildpad Agent Skills

Agent skills for building **Buildpad Apps** with AI coding agents. Each skill is a folder with a [`SKILL.md`](https://agentskills.io) following the open Agent Skills standard, so they work in Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity, and any other agent that supports the format.

This repository is the **source of truth** for the skills bundled in Buildpad project starters. Starters ship with the skills pre-installed; use the CLI below to update them or to add them to an existing project.

## Install

```bash
# Install skills (interactive picker)
npx skills add buildpad-ai/skills

# Install everything
npx skills add buildpad-ai/skills --all

# Install a single skill
npx skills add https://github.com/buildpad-ai/skills/tree/main/create-project
```

The [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) detects your agents and writes each skill to the right location (`.claude/skills/`, `.kiro/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, …).

## Update

```bash
npx skills check    # see what's outdated
npx skills update   # update installed skills
```

## Repository Layout

- **Skill folders (root)** — one folder per skill (`<name>/SKILL.md`), installable via the skills CLI.
- **`agents/`** — subagent personas (flat `.md` files with `name`/`description` frontmatter). Buildpad starters mirror them to `.kiro/agents/` (Kiro) and `.claude/agents/` (Claude Code), where they run as subagents in isolated context. The skills CLI does not install these — they ship with starters and starter agent-file downloads.

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | Five-axis code review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance) + DaaS/Buildpad compliance |
| [test-engineer](agents/test-engineer.md) | Test strategy, coverage-gap analysis, Playwright/Vitest authoring |
| [security-auditor](agents/security-auditor.md) | Auth, CORS/RLS, input handling, and secret review |

## Catalog

### Spec-driven development

The core methodology: every feature is specified as `requirements.md` (EARS) → `design.md` → `tasks.md` in `.kiro/specs/<feature>/`, then implemented task by task. The artifact format is compatible with Kiro IDE's native specs — **Kiro users should use native specs instead of these skills**; all other agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Antigravity, Cursor, …) use them as slash commands. Adapted from [gotalab/cc-sdd](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd) v3.0.2 (MIT), renamed under the `buildpad-` prefix.
